    # Define the steps for the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the code from the repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js (specify the Node.js version)

        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18' # Use the latest LTS Node.js version

      # Step 3: Cache `node_modules` to speed up builds

      # Step 4: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 5: Run linting (optional but recommended for code quality)
      - name: Run lint
        run: npm run lint

      # Step 6: Run tests (make sure you have a test script in `package.json`)
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      # Step 7: Build the Next.js project
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

  # Optional: Deploy step if you want to deploy to a platform like Vercel
  # deploy:
  #   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  #   needs: build  # Ensure this runs after the build step

  #   steps:
  #     - name: Checkout code
  #       uses: actions/checkout@v3

  #     - name: Set up Node.js
  #       uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  #       with:
  #         node-version: '18'

  #     # Authenticate with Vercel or other deployment platforms using secrets
  #     - name: Deploy to Vercel
  #       run: vercel --prod
  #       env:
  #         VERCEL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}  # Add your Vercel token in GitHub Secrets
